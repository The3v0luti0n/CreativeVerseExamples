The following are how I implemented a GUI Voting system for my Gun Game map!

Map Code: 7297-1444-5281

This uses a combination of triggers, one for each game mode. 
I use the pop-up dialog device to show the gui to the players on game start. 
When the buttons are pressed under each, the corresponding trigger will be fired, adding to the count. 
Once the timer for the voting is up (not included), it automatically totals them up to retrieve a Mode and Map winner!
